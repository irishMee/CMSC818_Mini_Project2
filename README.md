# CMSC818B_Mini_Project2

This work is part of a project for CMSC818B at the University of Maryland during the Fall 2020 semester. It contains our launch file and Gazebo world set up files. We have run the program created in the following work, 

H. Umari and S. Mukhopadhyay, “Autonomous robotic exploration based on multiple rapidly-exploring randomized trees,” in 2017 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS), Sep. 2017, pp. 1396–1402, doi: 10.1109/IROS.2017.8202319.


on a different Gazebo environment as a part of this school project. The set up code for the original project can be found here: https://github.com/hasauino/rrt_exploration

Follow the instructions to set up the necessary packages from the original project and then push the two launch files found in the Launch folder here to the rrt_exploration_tutorials\launch folder in your ROS environment. Download the Gazebo world to the rrt_exploration_tutorials\launch\includes\worlds folder.
